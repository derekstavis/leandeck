# Lean Deck

Tweaks a bunch of things that I don't care about:

* Removes saturation and shadows from home background hero
* Removes tabs from game view


Other themes that I also have enabled for the full lean experience:

* Better Blur
* Clean Gameview
* Icon Hider (hide everything)
* No Home Tabs
* Round (3px)
* Switch Like Home
